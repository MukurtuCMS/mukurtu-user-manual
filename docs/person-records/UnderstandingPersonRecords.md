# Understanding Person Records

Person records are a type of content that allow for rich, in-depth biographical records to be integrated into Mukurtu. Many different types of information can be integrated into person records. Some examples include:

- The dates of an individual's birth and death.
- Custom text and media sections enable multiple, focused, text-based or multi-media biographic sketches for an individual.
- Identification of relationships between the individual in the person record and other individuals. Mukurtu administrators can use the interpersonal relationship taxonomy to provide terms naming the type and degree of the relationship.
- Other names a person has been known by throughout their life can be linked to the individual in the person record, .
