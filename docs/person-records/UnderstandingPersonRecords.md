# Understanding Person Records

!!! roles "User role"

Person records are a content type that allows for rich, in-depth biographical records to be integrated into Mukurtu. Many different types of information can be integrated into person records. Some features include:

- The dates of an individual's birth and death.
- Custom text and media sections enable multiple, focused, text-based or multi-media biographic sketches for an individual.
- Identification of relationships between the individual in the person record and other individuals. Mukurtu administrators can use the interpersonal relationship taxonomy to provide terms naming the type and degree of the relationship.
- Other names a person has been known by throughout their life can be linked to the individual in the person record. This allows the individual to be properly identified by the name or names they are known by in their community, and can help to remove distortion caused by misnamings, misspellings, or mistaken attributions. 
- Person records allow users to aggregate all the digitial heritage items and other content in which an individual is referenced.

For more information about how to create and configure person records, see [Create Person Records](PersonRecords.md) or [Configure Person Record Settings](ConfigurePersonRecord.md).
