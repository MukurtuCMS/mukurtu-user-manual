Person Records allow for rich biographical records to be integrated into Mukurtu CMS. Person records can include birth and death dates as well as custom text and media sections. They can also identify relationships between people, and aggregate all digital heritage items where a person is referenced. They can also be used to link all the names that a person is known to the record as taxonomic people terms. Follow the instructions below to create a person record.

From your **Dashboard** or **Add Content**, select the **Person** link.

## Mukurtu Essentials tab

1. Enter the name of the person in the *Name* field. 

    - This is a required field.

2. Add media to the **Media Assets** section by selecting the "Add media" button. There is no limit on the number of media assets you can add.

    - To upload a media asset, navigate to the Media Assets section.
    - Select the "Add Media" button.
    - Select the type of content you want to add. You can upload an audio file, document, image, or video file.
    - Select the "Choose File" or "Browse" button to upload a file.
        
        !!! Tip
            The text of the upload button depends on your browser.

    - Select an file from your file explorer.
    - If you selected the incorrect file, remove it by selecting the "Remove" button after the file uploads.
    - Fill out the remaining metadata according to the [Media Upload Instructions by Media Type](../media/ByTypeMediaUpload.md) article.

3. Navigate to the **Sharing Setting** field to apply a sharing setting. Select **All** or **Any**.

    - All means that the item may only be shared with members belonging to ALL the protocols listed. This is the more restrictive setting. 
    - Any means the asset may be shared with members of ANY of the protocols listed. This is less restrictive.
    - This is a required field.

4. Use the checkboxes to apply cultural protocols to the media asset.

    - This is a required field.

5. In the **Date Born** section enter the date the person was born. Acceptable formats are `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`.
6. In the **Date Died** section enter the date the person died. Acceptable formats are `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`.
7. Use the checkbox to indicate whether the person is **Deceased**. This field informs the deceased person media content warning. For more information on this and other media content warnings, please see the [Media Content Warnings](../media/MediaContentWarnings.md) article.
8. In the **Keywords** section, add keywords to each field to describe the person. Keywords provide an additional way to categorize your content. In general, 3-5 keywords are recommended to make it easier for users to search and retrieve content. 
   
    - Select the "Add another item" button to add additional keyword text boxes.
    - Select and drag the arrows by the keyword to reorder your keywords if necessary.
    - To remove a keyword, select the "Remove" button.

9. Use the **Map Points** Leaflet map to enter one or more geographic locations for your person record. This can be an area that the person lived in, that they were associated with, or any other geographic location. Use the buttons on the right to enter points, paths, rectangles, or polyons to your map. You can also add markers to your map by uploading GeoJSON shapes.
