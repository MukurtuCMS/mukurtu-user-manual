# Edit community settings

!!! Roles "User Roles" 
	Community Manager

Once a community is created, you can edit your original settings at any time. This edit form also includes some settings that are not present in the initial **add community** form. 

## Name, description, and sharing protocol

Navigate to the community you wish to edit.

From the community menu options, select **edit**.

From here you can edit the *community name*, *description* and *sharing protocol*.

!!! WARNING 
	Sharing protocols affect the community page visibility. A strict protocol will limit visibility to community members, and an open protocol opens visibility to the public. Be careful when making changes to this setting.

## Community Type

!!! requirement
	A Mukurtu administrator must configure community types in the taxonomy settings before they can be assigned here. 

Community types help to organize the communities on your Mukurtu site. For example, a site might have tribal communities, libraries, and families contributing to a site. These can all be assigned a type for streamlined display and easy browse and search. To learn more about configuring community types, see [Create and Manage Community Types](../3Cs/CreateAndManageCommunityTypes.md)

- From the *community type* dropdown menu, select the appropriate term for your community.
