## Community Type

!!! requirement
	"A Mukurtu administrator must enable community types before they can be used here. See [Create and Manage Community Types](../3Cs/CreateAndManageCommunityTypes.md) for more information."

Community types help to organize the communities on your Mukurtu site. For example, a site might have tribal communities, libraries, and families contributing to a site. These can all be assigned a type for streamlined display and easy browse and search. 

 1. From the *community type* dropdown menu, select the appropriate term for your community.

## Banner and thumbnail images --NEED TO CONFIRM BANNER/THUMBNAIL IMAGE SIZES--

Banner and thumbnail images are optional styling elements. Banners appear across the top of a community page. Thumbnails appear on community browse pages and can help to make a community more easily recognizable, especially if there are many communities represented on your site.

## Featured content

Featured content gives users a preview of selected content contributed by the community. It displays the title and thumbnail of the content on the community page. Custom thumbnails are added by editing the content directly. This may be especially useful for non-image media such as audio and PDFs, which will otherwise display a stock graphic.
