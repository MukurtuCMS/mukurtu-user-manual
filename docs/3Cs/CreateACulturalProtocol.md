There are several ways to create a new cultural protocol. A separate article discusses [creating a community and initial cultural protocol](Create-a-community-and-initial-cultural-protocol.md).

This article covers two other methods for creating a cultural protocol - from the dashboard and through an existing community.

## Create a cultural protocol from the dashboard

1. From the Mukurtu Dashboard, select **Cultural Protocols**, then select "Add Protocol."

2. Name your protocol. It's helpful to name the organization or group associated with this protocol and indicate an access level. (i.e. CDSC Public).

3. Select a sharing protocol. **Any** means that a user must be a member of at least one of the assigned protocols to view the item. **All** means that a user must be a member of all assigned protocols to view the item. 

4. Add a description (if desired).

    !!! tip
        Items with just one protocol can use either setting. For more information, see [Sharing Settings](SharingSettings.md) 


5. In *communities* enter the community name. A list of communities you belong to will autopopulate. You may add additional communities to this protocol by selecting "Add another item".

    !!! Tip
        You must be a community member of the community you wish to add.

6. The remaining fields are optional. You may edit the author of the protocol in the *Authored by* field, specify a URL alias, and log any revisions. 

7. Check or uncheck *Published* and select "Save."

5. Repeat this step to add *protocol members*.

6. When you are finished, select "Save and Create Another Protocol" if you have additional protocols to add, or "Save" if you are finished. You can add additional protocols later using these steps.
