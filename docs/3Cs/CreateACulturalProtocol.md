# Create a cultural protocol

There are several ways to create a new cultural protocol. A separate article discusses [creating a community and initial cultural protocol](Create-a-community-and-initial-cultural-protocol.md).

This article covers two other methods for creating a cultural protocol - from the dashboard and through an existing community.

## Create a cultural protocol from the dashboard

1. From the Mukurtu Dashboard, select **Cultural Protocols**, then select "Add Protocol."

2. Name your protocol. It's helpful to name the community associated with this protocol and indicate appropriate access. For example, public collections at the Washington State University Library Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections (WSU-MASC) might use the protocol, WSU-MASC Public.

3. Select a sharing protocol. Sharing protocols determine who can access the protocol page and items under this protocol.

    - **Open**: Items under open protocol are accessible to all visitors, including those without user accounts.

    - **Strict**: Items under strict protocol will only be visible to logged in protocol members. The protocol page will not be visible to the public.

4. Add an optional description. Descriptions display on the protocol page and may include information about the purpose of the protocol, the type of content under this protocol, and who to contact if you have qustions.

5. In *communities* enter the community name. A list of communities of which you are the community administrator will autopopulate. ---THIS WILL CHANGE TO A DROP DOWN MENU EVENTUALLY SO YOU'LL HAVE TO UPDATE THIS---

    It's possible that related families, villages, clans, or other communities might want to keep their communities distinct and manage access to certain shared pieces of content with the same set of protocols. This is possible by adding additional communities to a protocol.

    To do this, select "Add another item" and a new field will appear where you can add another community. Repeat this step to add as many communities as needed.

    !!! Tip
        You must be a community manager in every community you wish to add.

6. When you are finished, select **Save**. You will be taken to the new protocol page. If you've added a banner image and description, you should be able to see them here. A confirmation message will also be displayed.

## Create a cultural protocol through an existing community

    Community Manager

1. Navigate to the page of the community to which you would like to add a protocol and select **Add cultural protocol**.

    You can view community pages through the main menu above your dashboard, or on the dashboard under **Communities**.

2. Add a *protocol name*, select a *sharing protcol* and add a *description* to your protocol.

    At this point, you can add protocol members and assign them to user roles, but this step is not necessary to create the protocol and can be done at any time. Note that ALL protocol members must first be community members. 

    Protocol user roles are: 

    -   Protocol stewards: Users with this role can manage membership (enrolling and removing users) and content (adding and deleting content).
    -   Protocol contributors: Users with this role can create digital heritage items within the protocol.
    -   Protocol members: Users with this role can view any content under the protocol unless that content is under multiple protocols, in which case they may need to be a member of all assigned protcols to access the content.

3. The steps to enroll a community member into any protocol user role are the same:

    -  Under the appropriate user role, select "Select Member"

    -  Enter their username in the search bar or select from the list of community members below. Select "Add Users." Once added, you can remove users by selecting "Remove" under their username. ---THE SEARCH BAR WILL CHANGE---

    ![Screenshot of the form for selecting protocol members. At the top is a search field and grey search button. Beneath that is a list of community members with a checkbox next to each name. Beneath that list is a blue button that says add users with a list of current users with grey buttons below their names that say remove. Below this is a blue button that says finished next to a grey button that says hide selected.](../_embeds//create-protocol-17.png)

4. When you are finished, select "Save and Create Another Protocol" if you have additional protocols to add, or "Save" if you are finished. You can add additional protocols later using these steps.

    ![Screenshot of the form for selecting protocol members. At the top is a grey button that says Select Members. Beneath that is a list of current members. Under that is the Protocol Members field title, with a grey button that says select members. Below that are two grey buttons. The button on the left says Save and create another protocol. The button on the right says save.](../_embeds//create-protocol-18.png)

5. Once the protocol is saved, you will be taken to the new protocol page. If you've added a banner image   and description, you should be able to see them here. A confirmation message will also be displayed.
