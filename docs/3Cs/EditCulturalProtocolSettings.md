## Banner and thumbnail images --THIS MIGHT CHANGE, ALSO CONFIRM IMAGE SIZES--

Banner and thumbnail images are optional styling elements. Banners appear across the top of a protocol page. Thumbnails appear --NOT SURE WHERE THEY APPEAR--

1. Under the image type you want to add, select "Add media."
2. Browse for image files on your computer or select existing images.
3. Add alt text and protocols to any new images. Make sure you choose protocols that enable visibility to your target audience.
4. Populate optional fields as needed.
5. Save your changes, then select "Insert Selected."

## Featured content

Featured content gives users a preview of selected content within this protocol. It displays the title and thumbnail of the content on the protocol page. Custom thumbnails are added by editing the content directly. This may be especially useful for non-image media such as audio and PDFs, which will otherwise display a stock graphic.

1. Expand featured content and select "Select Content."
2. Use the dropdown menu to narrow your search by content type, and the search field to search for specific content.
3. All available content is displayed below the search bar. Check the box next to each piece of content you wish to feature.
4. Select "Add Content."
5. Remove featured content by selecting the grey "Remove" button below each piece of content.

## Add/Remove communities

It's possible that related families, villages, clans, or other communities might want to keep their communities distinct and manage access to certain shared pieces of content with the same set of protocols. This is done by adding additional communities to a protocol. All associated communities are listed in this section. 
 
1. To remove an existing community, select "Remove."
2. To add a community, select "Add another item."

3. Begin typing a community name to pull up a list of available communities. Select the community you would like to add. 
4. Repeat this step to add as many communities as needed.

!!! Tip
    You must be a community manager in every community you wish to add.

## Membership display

Use this setting to determine how members are displayed on a cultural protocol page:

- Do not display: does not display protocol members.
- Display protocol stewards: displays only users assigned to the protocol steward role
- Display all members: displays all protocol members regardless of role.

## Save

When you are satisfied with your changes, select "Save." A success message will be displayed on the cultural protocols page.
