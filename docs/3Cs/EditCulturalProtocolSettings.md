# Edit Cultural Protocol Settings

!!! roles "User roles"

Cultural protocols can have a range of settings that can be updated once the protocol is created. Certain fields and settings are only available after the protocol has been created. To edit an existing protocol, navigate to the protocol, and select **edit**.

## Protocol Name

Use this field to edit the protocol name. It's helpful to name the community associated with this protocol and indicate type of access provided. For example, public collections at the Washington State University Library Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections (WSU-MASC) might use the protocol, WSU-MASC Public.

## Protocol type 
    
There are two types of protocols, open and strict. Select the appropriate protocol type.
    
Strict - Content that uses this cultural protocol is only visible to members of this cultural protocol. The cultural protocol page is also only visible to cultural protocol members.

Open - Content that uses this cultural protocol is visible to all site members and visitors, with no login required. The cultural protocol page is also visible.

## Description

Add or edit the protocol description. Descriptions display on the protocol page and may include information about the purpose of the protocol, the type of content under this protocol, and who to contact if you have questions.

## Banner and thumbnail images --THIS MIGHT CHANGE, ALSO CONFIRM IMAGE SIZES--

Banner and thumbnail images are optional styling elements. Banners appear across the top of a protocol page. Thumbnails appear --NOT SURE WHERE THEY APPEAR--

1. Under the image type you want to add, select "Add media."
2. Browse for image files on your computer or select existing images.
3. Add alt text and protocols to any new images. Make sure you choose protocols that enable visibility to your target audience.
4. Populate optional fields as needed. See [Media Asset Metadata](../media/MediaAssetMetadata.md) to learn more about these fields.
5. Save your changes, then select "Insert Selected."

## Featured content

Featured content gives users a preview of selected content within this protocol. It displays the title and thumbnail of the content on the protocol page. 

1. Expand featured content and select "Select Content."
2. Use the dropdown menu to narrow your search by content type, and the search field to search for specific content.
3. All available content is displayed below the search bar. Check the box next to each piece of content you wish to feature.
4. Select "Add Content."
5. Remove featured content by selecting the grey "Remove" button below each piece of content.

## Add/Remove communities

Each protocol is managed by at least one parent community. Protocols can also be managed jointly by multiple communities. If this is the case, additional parent communities can be assigned here. All parent communities will be displayed on the protocol page.
 
1. To add a parent community, select "Add another item." 
2. To remove an existing parent community, select "Remove."

4. Repeat this step to add as many communities as needed.

!!! Tip
    You must be a community manager in every community you wish to add.

## Membership display

Use this setting to determine how members are displayed on a cultural protocol page:

- Do not display: does not display protocol members.
- Display protocol stewards: displays only users assigned to the protocol steward role
- Display all members: displays all protocol members regardless of role.

## Save

When you are satisfied with your changes, select "Save." A success message will be displayed on the cultural protocols page.
