You can customize the order in which communities display on the community page, whether you're rearranging the order, creating parent-child hierarchies, or both.

1) From the dashboard, under communities, select **community organization**.

2) You will see a list of all communities on the site. Select the handle next to a community you wish to move and drag it to your desired location.

3) Drag the community up and down to re-order, to the right to create sub-communities, and to the left to create a higher-level community.

4) When you are satisfied with your arrangement, select Save.

The community organization page will reload with the new community arrangement.

You can view the communities in their new order on the Community page. Note that any sub-communities will be shown in the right side-bar of the parent community page.
