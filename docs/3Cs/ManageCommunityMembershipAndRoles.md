## Manage Community Members
Community managers are responsible for adding new members, assigning community roles and changing the membership state. This article provides instruction for each of these actions and instructions for bulk assigning community roles and membership states.

To begin, navigate to the community you wish to manage and select **Manage Members.**

A list of community members will be displayed. You can see how long they've been a community member, their assigned roles and membership state. 

There are three community roles: Community manager, community member, and community affiliate.

- Community managers are assigned by the Mukurtu administrator or other community managers within the community and are responsible for managing membership in the community. They can create and manage new user accounts, add and remove users from communities, create new cultural protocols, and manage Local Contexts projects and directories.

Community managers are also responsible for the look and feel of the community page. This includes the title, banner and thumbnail images, description, featured content and other display settings.

- Community members have basic membership in the community.  If they have not been added to any protocols, they can view the community page and any public content. 

- The community affiliates role is designated for users who aren't part of the community but work with the community in some capacity that requires a level of access to community content. Some examples include researchers, archivists and other collaborative partners. Community affiliates may be assigned other roles and protocols within the community.

There are three membership states: Active, pending and blocked. --MEMBERSHIP STATE MAY CHANGE IN DEVELOPMENT--

 - Active memberships have permission to view the community page and any protocols to which they've been added.
 - Pending memberships are for users who have requested membership in the community and have not yet been approved by the community manager.
 - Blocked memberships are not allowed access to the community page --IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THEY CAN'T ACCESS?--
