!!! roles "User role"

The actions community managers can take to manage community membership includes adding new members, assigning community roles and changing the membership state. This article provides instruction for each of these actions and instructions for bulk assigning community roles and membership states.

To begin, navigate to the community you wish to manage and select **Manage Members.**

A list of community members will be displayed. You should be able to see how long they've been a community member, their assigned roles and membership state. To read more about community roles, see [User role types](../users/user-role-types.md).

There are three membership states: Active, pending and blocked.

 - Active memberships have permission to view the community page and any protocols to which they've been added.
 - Pending memberships are for users who have requested membership in the community and have not yet been approved by the community manager.
 - Blocked memberships are not allowed access to the community page --IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THEY CAN'T ACCESS?--
