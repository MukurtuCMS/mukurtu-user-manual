# Understanding Communities and Cultural Protocols

## What are communities?

Communities are groups of people contributing to a Mukurtu site and represent the source of the content on a site. 

They can be large or small, and reflect real life groups such as tribal nations, repositories, families, classes, governing bodies, professional organizations, etc. They can also be further divided into sub-communities. 

A Mukurtu site can have as many communities as needed, and users can be members of multiple communities. Each site will define its' own communities. A site may have one community, or hundreds, and there is no limit to how many users can be added to a community, or how many communities a user can join.

## How are communities managed?

Communities are managed through a community manager. The community manager can add and remove members, and create new protocols. For more information on user roles, see User roles --LINK--

### Community Types

On any given site, there may be different types of communities. The community types taxonomy allows users to define the different types of communities that contribute to a site. Some examples include:

- libraries and museums
- families
- tribes etc. 

## What are cultural protocols?

Cultural protocols provide users appropriate access to content and is intended to reflect real life values surrounding access to cultural material. They are listed under the community to which they belong and can only be viewed by protocol members.

All content must belong to at least one cultural protocol so that users know where a piece of content came from and who has access. In Mukurtu 4, this includes media. Users will be prompted to assign a protocol to each media asset at the time of upload.

Cultural protocols are flexible and user defined. Some common examples include seasonal, gender-based, and sacred/ceremonial protocols. You can also use protocols administratively. Review protocols, for example, can limit access to cultural material while a committee reviews uploaded items before sharing them with wider audiences.

While cultural protocols can serve many purposes, functionally they are all the same. It is therefore recommended that protocol names include the parent community and describe appropriate access. Some generic examples include:

- Library and Archive Public Access
- Culture Committee Under Review
- Archive Department Private
- Tribal Office Employees Only

## How are cultural protocols managed?

Each cultural protocol is created by and managed within a community. Cultural protocols are managed by the protocol steward, who is assigned to the role by the community manager. Protocol stewards manage protocol membership (enrolling and removing members and assigning other protocol roles), and content (adding, updating and removing content).

### Cultural Protocol Types

There are two types of cultural protocols: open and strict, and they are determined in the "Cultural Protocol Types" setting of a cultural protocol.

- Open: Items under open protocols are accessible to all visitors, including those without user accounts.

- Strict: Items under strict protocols will only be visible to logged in protocol members. The protocol page will not be visible to the public.

One caveat to this rule is the use of multiple protocols: if two or more protocols are assigned to a piece of content, users may have to be members of all assigned protocols to access the content. This setting is specified individually, for each piece of content.

### Protocol User Roles

Protocols allow for members to take an active role in managing the content within a protocol:

- protocol member - views content but cannot add or edit.
- protocol affiliate - ???
- language steward - can add, edit and delete dictionary words and create language lists
- language contributor - can add dictionary words and create language lists
- contributor - can create new digital heritage items (only? or other pieces of content as well?)
- community record steward - can add, edit and delete community records
