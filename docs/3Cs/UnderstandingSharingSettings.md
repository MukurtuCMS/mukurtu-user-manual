# Understanding Sharing Settings

For content with multiple protocols assigned, sharing settings help to determine a content item's level of access. You will see this setting on all content types (digital heritage, dictionary word, person record and collection) The setting is a choice between *all* or *any*. 

**All**: An item with multiple protocols may only be viewed by members of ALL assigned protocols. 

**Any**: An item with multiple protocols may be viewed by a member of ANY assigned protocols.

For example, an item may be listed under two protocols: Dancers and Singers. Using the *Any* setting means the item could be viewed by anyone who is a member of the Dancers protocol, and anyone who is a member of the Singers protocol. It is the more inclusive option.

Using the *All* setting means the item would only be available to users who are members of both the Dancers *and* Singers protocols.

!!! note
    If you are only applying one protocol to the item, either setting will work. By default, the "All" setting will be applied.

## Using sharing settings
Select the setting that provides the most appropriate access to the content.

1. Under the Cultural Protocols settings of your content item form (digital heritage, dictionary, person record and collections), select the *sharing setting* you would like to use.

2. Select the protocols you would like to apply to the content.

## How sharing settings affect display

Here is an example of how each sharing setting affects content visibility: 

In the Singers and Dancers community, there are two strict protocols: Singers Only and Dancers Only. 

The community has two members: Singer1 and Dancer1. Singer1 has been added to the Singers Only protocol. Dancer1 has been added to the Dancers Only protocol. 

A digital heritage item has been uploaded under both protocols, and uses the sharing setting, *Any*.

When either user is logged in, they will be able to view the item.

Let's change the sharing setting on this same item to **All**.

--SREENSHOT OF DH ITEM WITH CULTURAL PROTOCOL SETTINGS. SINGERS ONLY AND DANCERS ONLY PROTOCOLS ARE SELECTED. THE SHARING SETTING IS SET TO "ALL"

Despite being logged in as Singer1 or Dancer1, the item is not visible, because these users need to belong to BOTH protocols to view the item.

Now let's say we've added Singer1 to the Dancers Only protocol. They now belong to both protocols.

Logged in as Singer1, with our sharing setting for this item still set to "all," we can now see the item. Dancer1 is still unable to view the item because they do not belong to both protocols.

In this way, access within a community can be fine tuned.
