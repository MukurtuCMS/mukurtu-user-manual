# Creating and Editing Categories

!!! roles "User roles"
    Mukurtu Administrators

Categories are high-level descriptive terms that help Mukurtu users discover digital heritage items. They are shared by all communities on a site. Each digital heritage item must belong to one or more category. Categories should reflect the type of content within your site. If the categories are too broad they won’t help users narrow down their search, but if they are too narrow they may not represent the scope of the site. Make sure that the category terms you choose make sense to your users by avoiding jargon and overly technical terms. 

The following are the steps to create and edit categories. 

## Create a category 

1. Select **Manage Categories**.

    - Enter the name of your category in the **Category Name** field.  
    - Enter any descriptive information in the **Description** field. This is a rich text field that can support text, links, media items, and other formats.
