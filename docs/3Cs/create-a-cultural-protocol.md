Add a community. Begin typing the name of the community to which this protocol belongs. Communities will auto populate as you type. You may add additional communities to this protocol by selecting **Add another item**. If you wish to credit someone else as the protocol's author, you may do so in the "Authored by" field. Note that they must be a community member.
