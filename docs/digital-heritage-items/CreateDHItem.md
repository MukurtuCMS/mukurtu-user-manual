Digital heritage items are one of the main content types of Mukurtu. At their core they offer a combination of media and metadata to tell a story and move beyond the notion of isolated items or records to allow for more context and relationships. Terminology at cultural heritage institutions may vary, so digital heritage items may represent items, records, content, belongings, objects, songs, stories, or other similar concepts. Digital heritage items can incorporate a range of media types, including images, documents, audio and video recordings, and embedded items. 

Mukurtu Core metadata schema is an extension of Dublin Core.

Follow the instructions to create a digital heritage item.
