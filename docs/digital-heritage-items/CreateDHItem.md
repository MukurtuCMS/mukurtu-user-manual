# Create a Digital Heritage Item

!!! roles "User roles"
    Protocol steward, contributor

Digital heritage items are one of the main content types of Mukurtu. At their core they offer a combination of media and metadata to tell a story and move beyond the notion of isolated items or records to allow for more context and relationships. Terminology at cultural heritage institutions may vary, so digital heritage items may represent items, records, content, belongings, objects, songs, stories, or other similar concepts. Digital heritage items can incorporate a range of media types, including images, documents, audio and video recordings, and embedded items. 

Mukurtu Core metadata schema is an extension of Dublin Core.

Follow the instructions to create a digital heritage item.

## Mukurtu essentials

### Title

Use the *Title* field to provide a title for your digital heritage item. The title should give users useful information about the item when browsing or searching.

    - This is a required field.

    - This is a required field.

### Category

Categories are high-level descriptive terms that group digital heritage items together and help users browse and discover digital heritage items. Categories are unique to each site and reflect the scope of the items included. One set of Categories is used to describe all digital heritage items within the site. 

- Check the box beside each relevant category.
- Each Digital Heritage Item must belong to at least one category.
