# Multipage Items

Multipage items are additions to digital heritage items that allow multiple pages with unique metadata to be added to an item. The pages can be navigated and browsed within the same digital heritage item page. Each page must share the same community and protocol to be part of the same item, but otherwise has completely unique metadata. This allows for granular page-level description, which makes information within an item more discoverable during search.  

One important note is that at this time all pages appear individually on the digital heritage browse page. While there are ways to work with this, some users find the display of multiple pages to add unwanted visual bulk to the browse pages. If you do not need unique page-level meatadata and prefer to avoid visual clutter on your browse pages, consider adding each page as a separate media asset within a single digital heritage item instead.

## Create a multipage item

1. From an existing digital heritage item or person record, select the "Create Multipage Item" button in the toolbar below the item or record's title. 
2. Enter a title for your multipage item. 

    !!! tip
        This is the umbrella title for the entire multipage item; the individual pages have their own titles. For example, if you are digitizing a yearbook this can be the title of the book. Subsequent pages are assigned their own title.

3. Select the checkbox by the digital heritage item(s) or person record(s) you want to include in your multipage item. Select the "Add content" button.
4. Select the "Save" button.

## Add new pages

There are two different ways to add new pages to your multipage item. For both methods navigate to Browse or Browse Digital Heritage and select your multipage item.

You can add existing digital heritage items or person records to multipage items.

4. Select the "Save" button to save your multipage item.

### From the "Add New Page" button 

You can add new digital heritage items or person records to multipage items.

1. Select the "Add new page" button.
2. New pages are created as additional digital heritage items or person records. For more information on creating digital heritage items, visit [Create Digital Heritage Items](CreateDHItem.md) or [Create Person Records](../person-records/CreatePersonRecords.md).
