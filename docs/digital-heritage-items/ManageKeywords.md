# Manage Keywords

Users can generate new keywords when content is created. There is a chance that errors need to be corrected, such as misspellings, capitalization inconsistency, or duplicate entries. You can manage keywords by editing, deleting, and merging them.

- Editing a keyword will apply to all digital heritage items that use that keyword.
- Deleting a keyword will remove it from all digital heritage items that use it.
- Merging one keyword into another will replace all uses of the first keyword in digital heritage items with the second keyword.

To manage keywords navigate to your **Dashboard** and select **Manage taxonomies** from the menu.

Navigate to **Keywords** and select **List Terms** from the dropdown menu.
