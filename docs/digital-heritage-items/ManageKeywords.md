# Manage Keywords

!!! roles "User role"

Users can generate new keywords when content is created. There is a chance that errors need to be corrected, such as misspellings, capitalization inconsistency, or duplicate entries. You can manage keywords by editing, deleting, and merging them.

- Editing a keyword will apply to all digital heritage items that use that keyword.
- Deleting a keyword will remove it from all digital heritage items that use it.
- Merging one keyword into another will replace all instances of the initial keyword in content with the updated keyword.

To manage keywords navigate to your **Dashboard** and select **Manage taxonomies** from the menu.

Navigate to **Keywords** and select **List Terms** from the dropdown menu.

## Edit a keyword

1. To edit a keyword, select the "Edit" button from the dropdown beside the keyword. 
2. Enter your preferred edits in the *Name* field. You can choose to enter a description in the *Description* field at this point. 

    !!! tip
        Descriptions can be helpful if you have two terms that are similar or that need further definition.

3. Select the "Save" button to save your keyword.

## Merge keywords

If you have two similar keywords, you can merge them into one term. This is helpful if you need to merge pluralized terms or other duplicate entries.

Select the **Merge** tab. You can merge terms into a new term or an existing term.
