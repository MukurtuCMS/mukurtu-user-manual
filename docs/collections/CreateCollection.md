# Create a Collection

!!! roles "User roles" 
    Protocol steward, Curator

To provide context or connections for some items or groups of items, communities may choose to use Mukurtu's Collections feature. Collections are a useful feature that help protocol stewards and curators arrange content in ways that help provide a more comprehensive context for that content. The creator of the collection determines the way the collection is arranged, including the order in which content is displayed. Users only see those items they have access to based on their cultural protocols. Collections provide users with a more curated or guided experience of the site's content. 
You can create a collection in Mukurtu from your **Dashboard** or by selecting **Add Content**.

## Create a new collection 

To create a collection from your dashboard, select **Dashboard** and scroll down to the **Collection** link.

Begin by filling out the metadata fields in the **Mukurtu Essentials** tab. 

1. Use the *Collection name* field to provide a name for your collection. This is a required field.

2. Select a **Sharing setting**. Sharing setting has two options: you can select **Any** or **All**. Any is the less restrictive setting as it means that the content can be shared with people belonging to any one or more of the protocols selected. All is more restrictive as users must belong to all the selected protocols to view the collection. This is a required field.

3. Apply cultural protocols by selecting the checkbox beside any cultural protocols that should be applied to this collection.

    - To add a point, select the first draw marker at the top right of the map. 
    - To add a polyline, select the second draw marker to the right of the map.
    - To add a rectangle, select the third draw marker to the right of the map.
    - To add a polygon, select the fourth draw marker to the right of the map.
    
10. Add a *Location Description*. If a location has identifying characteristics but is not able to be pinpointed on a map this field can be used instead of the mapped location. It can also be used to add additional context to the map points. This is a full HTML field that can also supports additional media items.

11. In the *Location* field, provide a taxonomic location term for your collection.

    You can save your Collection at this point. Return to the top of your page to select the **Relations** tab to add content to your collection.

12. In the **Items in Collection** section, select the "Select Content" button. Digital heritage items, person records, dictionary words, and other content can be included in a collection. 

13. Select the checkbox beside all the content you wish to include in the collection, then scroll down and select "Add Content".

    If you choose to create any sub-collections, they can be added by selecting the "Select Content" button in the **Sub-Collections** section. Sub-collections must have already been created to be added from this section.

    If you have any related content to the collection, select the "Select Content" button in the **Related Content** section.

14. Select whether you want to save this collection as a draft or as a published collection. Select either **Draft** or **Published**, then select the "Save" button. You also have the option to preview your collection by selecting "Preview".

To create a collection from **Add Content** select the **Collections** link.
