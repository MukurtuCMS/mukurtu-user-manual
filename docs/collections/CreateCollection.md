# Create a Collection

!!! roles "User roles" 
    Protocol steward, Curator

To provide context or connections for some items or groups of items, communities may choose to use Mukurtu's Collections feature. Collections are a useful feature that help protocol stewards and curators arrange content in ways that help provide a more comprehensive context for that content. The creator of the collection determines the way the collection is arranged, including the order in which content is displayed. Users only see those items they have access to based on their cultural protocols. Collections provide users with a more curated or guided experience of the site's content. 

## Create a new collection 

1. There are two ways to create a collection in Mukurtu. You can create a collection from your **Dashboard** or by selecting **Add Content**.
    
    - To create a collection from your dashboard, select **Dashboard** and scroll down to the **Collection** link.

    - To create a collection from **Add Content** select the **Add Content**, then select the **Collection** link.

    The remaining steps to create a collection are the same.

2. Use the *Collection name* field to provide a name for your collection. This is a required field.
3. Select a **Sharing setting**. Sharing setting has two options: you can select **Any** or **All**. Any is the less restrictive setting as it means that the content can be shared with people belonging to any one or more of the protocols selected. All is more restrictive as users must belong to all the selected protocols to view the collection. This is a required field.
4. Apply cultural protocols by selecting the checkbox beside any cultural protocols that should be applied to this collection.

5. Use the *Summary* field to provide a summary of your collection. This field is limited to 255 characters. 
6. Use the *Description* field to provide a description of your collection. This is a full HTML field that also supports additional media.
7. Use the *Image* field to select a representative thumbnail image for your collection. Select the "Add media" button to access the media library. You can either upload an image or select one from your media library.
    - From your computer: select the "Choose File" or "Browse" button to upload an image from your computer. The terms on the button are browser dependent. 
    - From the media library: select the checkbox on the image you want to add as a thumbnail. 

    Select the "Insert selected" button to insert your thumbnail.
