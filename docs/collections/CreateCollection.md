# Create a Collection

!!! roles "User roles" 
    Protocol steward, curator

Collections are a tool to group and arrange content, can be used to provide additional context on those materials, and provide users a more guided or curated experience. The creator of the collection can arrange the contents in a structured way, provide a description of the collection, and select a featured image. Display of individual items within the collection is still controlled by their specific cultural protocols.

## Create a new collection 

There are two ways to create a collection in Mukurtu. You can create a collection from your **Dashboard** or by selecting **Add Content**.
    
- To create a collection from your dashboard, navigate to your **Dashboard** and scroll down to the **Collection** link.

- To create a collection from **Add Content** navigate to **Add Content**, then select the **Collection** link.

The remaining steps to create a collection are the same.

## Mukurtu essentials

1. Use the *Collection name* field to provide a name for your collection. The collection name should give users useful information about the collection when browsing or searching.

    - This is a required field.

2. Use the checkboxes to apply cultural protocols to your collection. 

    - This is a required field.

3. Use the checkboxes to select a **Sharing setting**. Sharing setting has two options: you can select **Any** or **All**. 

    - Any is the less restrictive setting as it means that the content can be shared with people belonging to any one or more of the protocols selected. 
    - All is more restrictive as users must belong to all the selected protocols to view the collection. 
    - This is a required field.

    !!! tip
        The summary, description, and thumbnail fields help users browse your collections by providing context and a more curated experience.

4. Use the *Summary* field to give a brief statement describing your collection. This can be used to provide information about the meaning or structure of the collection. This field is limited to 255 characters. 
5. Use the *Description* field to provide a longer description of your collection. The description provides a broader narrative that can include the meaning and structure of the collection. Some examples of the ways the type of content included in the collection, why that content was chosen, the way the collection is arranged, or any other relevent information for users browing your collections. This is a full HTML field that supports text, audio, images, and video.

6. Use the *Image* field to select a representative thumbnail image for your collection. Thumbnails provide a visual that can serve as a preview of what the collection is about. Select the "Add media" button to access the media library. You can either upload an image or select one from your media library.

    - From your computer: select the "Choose File" or "Browse" button to upload an image from your computer. The terms on the button are browser dependent. 
    - From the media library: select the checkbox on the image you want to add as a thumbnail. 

    Select the "Insert selected" button to insert your thumbnail.

7. Use the *Keywords* to add any keywords to your collection. Keywords are terms used to describe content to ensure that the item will be discoverable when searching or browsing. They are more flexible and specific than categories. Consider adding 3-5 keywords to your collection by selecting the "Add another item" button to add additional keywords fields.

8. Use the *Source* field provide information indicating the resource, collection, or institution where the collection was contributed or originated. This could include collections (eg: `McWhorter Collection`), institutions (eg: `Library of Congress, American Folklife Center`), or donors (eg: `Donated by John Smith`).  
9. Select *Map Points* for your collection. You can include points, paths, rectangles, or polygons to indiciate physical location references for your collection. **IDEALLY THIS SHOULD LINK TO A MAPPING TUTORIAL**
    - To add a point, select the first draw marker at the top right of the map. 
    - To add a polyline, select the second draw marker to the right of the map.
    - To add a rectangle, select the third draw marker to the right of the map.
    - To add a polygon, select the fourth draw marker to the right of the map.

10. Add a *Location Description*. If a location has identifying characteristics but is not able to be pinpointed on a map this field can be used instead of the mapped location. It can also be used to add additional context to the map points. This is a full HTML field that also supports additional media.
11. Use the *Location* field to provide a taxonomic location term for your collection.
