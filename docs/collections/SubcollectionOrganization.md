Collections and personal collections can be structurally organized in hierarchies by creating subcollections. Creating a subcollection follows the same process as [creating a collection](CreateCollection.md). Assigning a subcollection to a parent collection can be done in two ways. 

To create a subcollection from the parent collection page, navigate to the page you want to assign as a parent collection. Select the "New Subcollection" button, then fill in the information for your subcollection.

You can also make existing collections subcollections by rearranging them on the dashboard. From the dashboard, navigate to **Manage Content**. 

1. In the *Content Type* field, select "Collection", then select "Search". In the **Action** dropdown menu, select the option "Add to Collection".
2. Select the checkbox beside the collection you want to assign as a subcollection. 
3. Select "Apply to selected items". 
4. Select the parent collection from the dropdown menu, then select "Apply" to assign your chosen collection as a subcollection.
