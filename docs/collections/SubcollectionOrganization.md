# Sub-collection Organization

!!! roles "User roles" 
    Protocol steward, Curator, Registered user

Collections and personal collections can be structurally organized in hierarchies by creating sub-collections. Creating a sub-collection follows the same process as [creating a collection](CreateCollection.md) and can be done from the dashboard or from the parent collection page. Assigning a sub-collection to a parent collection can be done from the parent collection page. 

## New sub-collection

You can create a new sub-collection from a parent collection page.

1. Select the "New Sub-collection" button at the top of the parent collection page.

2. Create your sub-collection by going through the same processes you used to create your parent collection. Those instructions are found in the [Creating a Collection](CreateCollection.md) article.

## Assign existing sub-collection

There are two different ways to assign an existing collection as a sub-collection. These are also completed within the parent collection. You can assign a sub-collection by editing the parent collection or by selecting the "Manage Collection Organization" button. 

### From "Edit" 

1. From the parent collection page, select "Edit".

2. Start typing the sub-collection name in the text box to bring up a list of your existing sub-collections. Select the sub-collection you want to assign, then select "Add to Organization".

3. Your new sub-collection will populate under Collection. You must click and drag it under the parent collection to assign it as a subcollection.

    !!! warning
        If you do not select and drag the sub-collection under the parent collection before saving, it will not be assigned as a sub-collection.

4. Select "Save" to save your collection organization.
