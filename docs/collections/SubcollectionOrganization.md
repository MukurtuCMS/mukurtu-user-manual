# Sub-collection Organization

Collections can be extended by including sub-collections, which work like subfolders and provide a hierarchical structure to further arrange content within the collection.

Sub-collections include all the same fields as a regular collection, and can have different cultural protocols than their parent collection. 

There are two ways to create a sub-collection:

- By creating a new sub-collection from the parent collection page.
- By assigning an existing collection as a sub-collection within the parent collection. This is useful if you already have existing collections and later want to rearrange them, or you accidentally created a collection that should have been a sub-collection.

## New sub-collection

You can create a new sub-collection from a parent collection page.

1. Select the "New Sub-collection" button at the top of the parent collection page.

2. Create your sub-collection by going through the same processes you used to create your parent collection. Those instructions are found in the [Create a Collection](CreateCollection.md) article.

## Assign existing sub-collection

There are two different ways to assign an existing collection as a sub-collection. These are completed from the parent collection page. You can assign a sub-collection by editing the parent collection or by selecting the "Manage Collection Organization" button. 

### From "Edit" 

1. From the parent collection page, select "Edit".

        Select the "Remove" button if you need to remove a sub-collection.

### From "Manage Collection Organization" 

1. From the parent collection page, select "Manage Collection Organization".

2. Start typing the sub-collection name in the text box to bring up a list of your existing sub-collections. Select the sub-collection you want to assign, then select "Add to Organization".
3. Your new sub-collection will populate under Collection. You must click and drag it under the parent collection to assign it as a subcollection.

    !!! warning
        You must select and drag the sub-collection under the parent collection before saving for it to be assigned as a sub-collection.
