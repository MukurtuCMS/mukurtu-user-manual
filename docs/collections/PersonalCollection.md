    - To create a personal collection from your dashboard, navigate to "Personal Collections" in your dashboard.

3. In the *Personal collection name* field, enter a name for your collection.
4. Select a **Privacy Setting**. Personal collections can be either public or private. Private personal collections are only visible to you, while public personal collections are accessible by anyone. Privacy settings do not override assigned cultural protocols. Any items under strict protocols are only accesible to protocol members.

    !!! tip
        You may choose to add a summary, description, and thumbnail to your personal collection. These are helpful for keeping multiple private personal collections organized. If your personal collections are public these fields can help other users browse your personal collection.

8. From the **Items** tab, select the "Select Content" button. 

    !!! tip 
        You can filter content by type or search by title.

    - Scroll down and select the checkbox beside the content you want to add to your personal collection.
   
    - Select "Add Content" to add the content to your personal collection.
