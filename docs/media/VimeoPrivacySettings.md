Vimeo's paid plans offer multiple privacy settings. For more information on these settings, visit [Vimeo privacy information](https://vimeo.com/features/video-privacy).

These privacy settings will allow your videos to be added to the Mukurtu media library and viewed by users. Content and media protocols apply.

- **Public**
- **Unlisted**
- **Hide from Vimeo**

These privacy settings will not allow your videos to work as expected in Mukurtu.

- **Private**. You cannot add private videos to the media library. If a video is added and then set to private, it will no longer play in Mukurtu. 
- **Password**. You can add password protected videos to the media library, but the password will be required for a user to view the videos.

## Embed permissions can limit function

Mukurtu cannot display Vimeo media assets if **Embed privacy** is set to **Nowhere**. To change your embed permissions, complete the following steps.

1. Select the "Share" button.
