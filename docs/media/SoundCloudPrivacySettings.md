**Scheduled** tracks are only available to paid Artist Pro subscribers. It allows you to schedule when your tracks shift from **Private** to **Public**.

## Embed permissions can limit function

Mukurtu cannot display SoundCloud media assets in content items without an embedded-player code. To enable this setting, select the ellipsis button on your SoundCloud asset.
