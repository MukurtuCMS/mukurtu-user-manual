SoundCloud offers limited privacy settings. For more information on these settings, visit [SoundCloud privacy information](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003562388-Changing-your-track-s-privacy-setting).

## SoundCloud privacy settings

These privacy settings allow your tracks, albums, and playlists to be added to the Mukurtu media library and accessed by users. Content and media protocols apply.

**Scheduled** tracks are only available to paid Artist Pro subscribers. This feature allows you to schedule when your tracks shift from **Private** to **Public**.
