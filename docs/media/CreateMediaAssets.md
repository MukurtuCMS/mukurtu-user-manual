Mukurtu supports several different types of media assets. These include audio files, SoundCloud links, documents, external embeds, image files, remote video links from Vimeo and YouTube, and video files. The way you create media assets varies slightly for different types of assets, but generally follows a similar workflow. 

This article provides a basic overview of how to create media assets, along with some special considerations for different media types. For step-by-step instructions on creating different types of media assets, please see [Media Upload Instructions by Media Type](ByTypeMediaUpload.md).

## Overview 

There are two ways to create a media asset: from your dashboard or while creating content. Some elements will look different depending on whether you are adding media from your dashboard or while creating content, but the workflow for both are the same.

- When adding media from your dashboard, select "Add Media". When adding media from content, selecting "Add Media" in the **Media Assets** field allows you to add different media types. 
	- When adding media from content, the media type may be restricted by the type of content that is being created.
- To upload audio, document, image, or video files, select the "Choose File" or "Browse" button. 

!!! tip
	Depending on your browser, the text on the button may vary.

- To insert remote video, SoundCloud, or external embeds, copy and paste the URL or embed code.
- Media asset metadata for is briefly described below. For more details, visit the [Media Asset Metadata](MediaAssetMetadata.md) support document.
- Once your media assets are part of your media library, they can easily be added to your content
