Mukurtu supports several different types of media assets. These include audio files, SoundCloud links, documents, external embeds, image files, remote video links from Vimeo and YouTube, and video files. The way you create media assets varies slightly for different types of assets, but generally follows a similar workflow. 

This article provides a basic overview of how to create media assets, along with some special considerations for different media types. For step-by-step instructions on creating different types of media assets, please see [Media Upload Instructions by Media Type](ByTypeMediaUpload.md).

## Overview 

There are two ways to create a media asset: from your dashboard or while creating content. Some elements will look different depending on whether you are adding media from your dashboard or while creating content, but the workflow for both of these are the same.

- When adding media from your dashboard, you can select "Add Media". When adding media from content, selecting "Add Media" in the **Media Assets** field allows you to add different media types. 
	- When adding media from content, the media type may be restricted by the content that is being created.
- You can select the "Choose File" or "Browse" button for uploading audio, document, image, or video files. 

!!! tip
	Depending on your browser, the text on the button may vary.

- You can insert the URL or embed code for remote video, SoundCloud, or external embeds.
- Media asset metadata for is briefly described below. For more details, visit the [Media Asset Metadata](MediaAssetMetadata.md) support document.
- Once your media assets are part of your media library, they can easily be added to your content. 

!!! warning 
	Note that externally hosted resources cannot be protected by cultural protocols. 

## Considerations for locally hosted media files 

- Names are automatically generated from the filename of the media. 
- Make sure you select a *Sharing Setting* and *Cultural Protocol* to apply to your media. 

## Considerations for remotely hosted media 

- Enter the URL to link to your media asset.  
- Filenames automatically generate for remotely hosted media.
- Make sure you select a *Sharing Setting* and *Cultural Protocol* to apply to your media. 

## Considerations for embedded media

- The name of your externally embedded media is not auto-generated.
- Enter the embed code to add your externally embedded media to the media library.
- You must select a thumbnail image for your external embed.
	- In the **Thumbnail** field, select the "Browse" button to upload an image file or drag and drop an image file from your file explorer.
	- Alternative text is required for the thumbnail image. This short description is used by screen readers and displayed when the image is not loaded. It is important for accessability. This is a required field.
