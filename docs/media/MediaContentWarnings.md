# Media Content Warnings

!!! roles "User role"
    Mukurtu administrator

Media content warnings are a specific type of media tag that enables Mukurtu administrators to flag potentially sensitive media assets. There are two different types of media content warnings: taxonomy triggered warnings and deceased person warnings. When a user comes to a page with a media asset that has a content warning, they are presented with a blacked-out box in place of the media asset overlaid with descriptive text. The user can choose to click through to access the media. This feature does not prevent users from accessing media assets, but it presents them the choice to access it if they want to after being made aware of its sensitive nature. 

Media content warnings can be applied in many different ways according to the community's needs. Some communities may decide to apply person warnings to let community members know that they may be viewing media that has images or recordings of persons who are deceased. Some ways that communities have chosen to apply taxonomy triggered media content warnings are as trigger warnings to inform users of media assets that might have violent or triggering content for some users. 

Creating media content warnings is a multi-step process. These parts need to be done in the order they are presented here to generate media content warnings and apply them to your media assets. 

Sites can have many different media content warnings configured, and media assets can have more than one media content warning applied. 

A completed media content warning can look like this:
