# Media Content Warnings

!!! roles "User role"
    Mukurtu administrator


Media content warnings are a specific type of media tag that enables Mukurtu administrators to flag potentially sensitive media assets. When a user comes to a page with a media asset that has a content warning, they are presented with a blacked-out box in place of the media asset overlaid with descriptive text. The user can choose to click through to access the media. This feature does not prevent users from accessing media assets, but it presents them the choice to access it if they want to after being made aware of its sensitive nature. 

Media content warnings can be applied in many different ways according to the community's needs. Some ways that communities have chosen to apply media content warnings are as trigger warnings to inform users of media assets that might have violent or triggering content for some users. 

Creating media content warnings is a two part process. First you generate a media tag to act as the term, or name, of your media content warning. Then you create the media content warning itself. These parts need to be done in the order they are presented here to generate a media content warning and apply it to your media assets. To begin, navigate to your dashboard. 

## Create a media tag

1. Under the **Additional content settings** section of the dashboard, select the **Manage Taxonomies** link.
