There are two ways to add media assets to your media library in Mukurtu CMS. You can add media assets from your dashboard, which is explained in the [Media Upload Instructions by Media Type](ByTypeMediaUpload.md) article. The other way to add media assets is to add media while you are creating content. 

To add media assets while you are creating content, navigate to your **Dashboard** or to **Add Content**. 

- From your dashboard, navigate to the **Add Content** link and select which content type you would like to add. Collection, dictionary word, digital heritage item, and person record are all content types.

- From **Add Content**, select the type of content you would like to add. Article, collection, dictionary word, digital heritage item, basic page, person record, and word list are all content types.

This article uses **Create Digital Heritage** as an example, but the process is the same for creating media from all content types.
