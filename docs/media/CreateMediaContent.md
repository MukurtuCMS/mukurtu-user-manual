There are two ways to add media assets to your media library in Mukurtu CMS. You can add media assets from your dashboard, which is explained in the [Media Upload Instructions by Media Type](ByTypeMediaUpload.md) article. The other way to add media assets is to add media while you are creating content. 

To add media assets while you are creating content, navigate to your **Dashboard** or to **Add Content**. 

- From your dashboard, navigate to the **Add Content** link and select which content type you would like to add. Collection, dictionary word, digital heritage item, and person record are all content types.
