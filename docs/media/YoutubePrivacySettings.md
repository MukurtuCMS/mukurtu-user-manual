Youtube offers limited privacy settings.

These privacy settings will allow your videos to be added to the Mukurtu media library and viewed by users. Content and media protocols apply.

- **Public**.
- **Unlisted**.

These privacy settings will not allow your videos to work as expected in Mukurtu.

- **Private**. You cannot add private videos to the media library. If a video is added and then set to private, it will no longer play in Mukurtu. 

## Embed permissions can limit function

Mukurtu cannot display YouTube media assets if Allow embedding is not enabled. To enable this setting, select **Show more** in **Video details**.
