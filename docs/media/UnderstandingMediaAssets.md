Media assets are the core element of digital heritage items and other content. Mukurtu provides wide support for many different media types, including images, documents, video, audio files, or embedded media. Media can be uploaded or hosted from an external site such as Vimeo or YouTube. 

Mukurtu supports several different types of media assets. These include:

- Audio 
- Documents 
- External Embeds 
- Images 
- Remote Video 
- SoundCloud 
- Video Files 

You can apply media assets to content and taxonomic records, such as digital heritage items, dictionary words, person and place records, and other facets of Mukurtu. Most items do not have a limit on the number of associated media assets. 

Digital heritage items generally feature at least one media asset, and can contain multiple media assets as metadata in the cultural narrative, traditional knowledge, and description fields. Digital heritage items also allow multi-page items, which can compile multiple media assets into one digital heritage item. One common use for the multi-page is to showcase a yearbook or newspaper. 

Dictionary words can use multiple audio files to provide users more comprehensive pronounciation examples. In some cases, audio files are used to provide an example of the way a word or phrase is pronounced according to the age, gender, or region of the speaker. You can also apply an image thumbnail to dictionary words. 

One use case for videos is as descriptive metadata, where they can provide unique cultural context and information for a digital heritage item. 

Mukurtu CMS is designed to be used as part of an access and preservation ecosystem. In general, Mukurtu's platform makes it easy for communities and organizations to provide access to digital materials but is not intended for preservation.
