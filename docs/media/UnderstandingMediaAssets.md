Media assets are the core element of digital heritage items and other  and can be images, documents, video, audio files, or embedded media. 

Mukurtu CMS is designed to be used as part of an access and preservation ecosystem. In general, Mukurtu's platform makes it easy for users to provide access to digital materials but is not intended for preservation. Mukurtu supports several different types of media assets. These include:

- Audio 
- SoundCloud 
- Documents 
- External Embeds 
- Images 
- Remote Video 
- Video Files 

You can apply media assets to content and taxonomic records, such as digital heritage items, dictionary words, person and place records, and other facets of Mukurtu. Most items do not have a limit on the number of associated media assets.
