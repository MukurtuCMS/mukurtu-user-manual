# Levels of Local Contexts Projects

## Levels of Local Contexts Projects

Local Context projects can be added at three different levels: site-wide, per community, and per protocol. This helps determine who can apply the labels and notices in the project. Users who can create and edit content will be able to apply labels and notices, provided they are in a community or protocol that has projects added.

See [Understanding the Local Contexts Hub](./UnderstandingTheLocalContextsHub.md) for more information on Local Contexts labels and notices.

## Site-wide projects

When a project is added to the entire site, all users with a content creating role have access to the labels and notices in the project. The project does not need to be added to any community or protocol.


## Community-based projects

When a project is added to a community, all community members with a content creating role have access to the labels and notices in the project. If another community needs to use those labels and notices, the project must be added to that community. 


For example, Community 1 has two protocols, Protocol A and Protocol B. A Local Contexts project was added to the community. This means that members of both protocols can use the project's labels and notices. The project does not need to be added to either protocol.

Community 2 also needs to use the project's labels and notices. The project must be added to Community 2. 


## Protocol-based projects

When a project is added to a protocol, the labels and notices in the project can be used by members of that protocol with a content creating role. It cannot be used by the rest of the community.

Continuing with our example, another project was added to Protocol A. This means that the project's labels and notices can only be used by members of Protocol A. Members of Protocol B cannot use them.

The same project could then be added to Protocol B to give members of that protocol access to the project's labels and notices.
