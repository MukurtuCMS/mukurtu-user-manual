# Levels of Local Contexts Projects

## Levels of Local Contexts Projects

Local Context projects can be applied at three different levels: site, community and protocol. This allows for more granular control over who can apply the labels and notices within a project. See [Understanding the Local Contexts Hub](./UnderstandingTheLocalContextsHub.md) for more information on Local Contexts labels and notices.

The ability to use labels and notices in content depends on community and protocol membership, and user role. Users who can create and edit content will be able to apply labels and notices, provided they are in a community or protocol that has projects applied.

## Applying projects at the protocol level

When applied at the protocol level, the labels and notices in the project can be used by members of that protocol with a content creating role.

For example, Community 1 has two protocols, Protocol A and Protocol B. A Local Contexts project was applied to Protocol A. This means that the projects' labels and notices would be available to members of Protocol A. Members of Protocol B would not be able to use them.

The same project could also be applied to Protocol B to give members of that protocol access to the labels and notices. 

To learn about managing a Local Contexts project at the protocol level, see [Manage protocol based Local Contexts projects](./ManageProtocolBasedLocalContextsProjects.md)

## Applying projects at the community level

When a project is applied to a community, all members with a content creating role, regardless of protocol membership, have access to the labels and notices in the project.

Using our previous example, if the project above were applied to Community 1, the labels and notices would be available to both Protocols A and B, and it would be unecessary to apply that same project at the protocol level.

## Applying projects at the site level

Projects applied at the site level provide access to labels and notices for ALL site users with content creating roles and do not need to be applied at the community or protocol levels for users to be able to apply them to content.
