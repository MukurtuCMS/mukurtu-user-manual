Local Contexts projects can be managed at three different levels: site-wide, per community, and per protocol. This article provides instructions for adding and managing projects at each level. For more about how projects work in Mukurtu, see [Levels of Local Contexts Projects](./LevelsOfLocalContextsProjects.md).

To learn more about Local Contexts, and the Local Contexts Hub see [Understanding the Local Contexts Hub](./UnderstandingTheLocalContextsHub.md)

!!! Requirement
    The following steps can only be applied after you've created a Local Contexts profile and account, configured your labels within projects, and generated a unique project ID. To learn more about this process, and configure your labels, visit [Getting Started on the Hub](https://localcontexts.org/support/getting-started-on-the-hub/)

## Get your project ID

To add a project to your site, you will first need your project ID number. In your Local Contexts project, scroll down to the "Identifiers" section. Find and copy the project ID number. You will be pasting it into your Mukurtu site. 

Follow the steps below to add the project ID to the entire site, or to individual communities or protocols.
