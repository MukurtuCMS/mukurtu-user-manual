Local Contexts projects can be applied at the site-wide, community, and protocol levels. This article shows you how to apply a project to a Mukurtu site at each of these levels. To understand how a project works at when applied to any given level, see [Levels of Local Contexts Projects](./LevelsOfLocalContextsProjects.md).

To learn more about Local Contexts, and the Local Contexts Hub see [Understanding the Local Contexts Hub](./UnderstandingTheLocalContextsHub.md)

The following steps can only be applied after you've created a Local Contexts profile and account, configured your labels within projects, and generated a unique project ID. To learn more about this process, and configure your labels, visit [Getting Started on the Hub](https://localcontexts.org/support/getting-started-on-the-hub/)

## Get your project ID

Before you begin to add projects to your site, you will need your project ID number. In your Local Contexts project, scroll down to the "Identifiers" section and find the project ID number. To apply the project's labels and notices to your site, copy the number, and paste it into your site at the appropriate level. Continue reading for instructions on how to do this at each level: site, community and protocol.
