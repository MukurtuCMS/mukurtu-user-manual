## View project directories

Project directory pages exist for the site, and within communities and protocols and display all the projects that have been added at each level, along with their labels and notices grouped by type. 

When configuring your project in Local Contexts, you can add contacts, background information and metadata to your project. When you add a project to your site, this information will be displayed on the directory page. 

To view project directories within a community or protocol, navigate to the community or protocol you wish to view and select **Local Contexts Project Directory**. 

To view the site project directory, go to the dashboard and select **Local Contexts Projects.**
