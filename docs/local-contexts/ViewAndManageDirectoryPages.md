## View project directories
Local Context projects can be applied at three different levels: site, community and protocol. 

Project directory pages exist at each level and display all relevant projects and their labels and notices grouped by type. Any background information that has been added about the project will also be displayed here. 

For more on how projects work at different levels, see [Levels of Local Contexts Projects](./LevelsOfLocalContextsProjects.md)

To view project directories at the community and protocol level, navigate to the community or protocol you wish to view and select **Local Contexts Project Directory**. 

To view project directories at the site level, go to the dashboard and select **Local Contexts Projects.**

## Manage project directories

To manage a project directory at the community or protocol levels, navigate to the community or protocol you wish to manage and select **Manage Local Contexts Project Directory**. 

To manage a project directory at the site level, go to the dashboard and select **Manage Site Local Contexts Projects Directory**

Here you can add a description to the project directory. Descriptions can include information about the project and how labels are being used. When finished, select "Save." The directory will load and a description will appear on the project directory.  --NOT SURE ABOUT THIS - IT CURRENTLY RELOADS THE MANAGE PAGE WITH NO SUCCESS MESSAGE--
