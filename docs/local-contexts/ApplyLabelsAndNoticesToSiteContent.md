Local Contexts labels and notices can be applied to all content within Mukurtu:

- collections
- dictionary words and word lists
- digital heritage items
- person records

The following steps can only be applied after you have configured your Local Contexts projects and added them to your Mukurtu site. 

To learn more about configuring Local Contexts projects and labels, visit Local Contexts' article, [Getting Started on the Hub](https://localcontexts.org/support/getting-started-on-the-hub/)

To learn more about adding Local Contexts projects to your site, see [Manage Local Context Projects](Link).

Proceed with the steps below when you have added your Local Contexts project(s) to your site.

## Apply labels to content

1. For existing content, navigate to the content to which you wish to apply a label or notice. 

    For new content, go to the dashboard under **Add Content** and select the content type you would like to add. Note that your user role may limit the type of content you are allowed to create and edit.


2. Locate the *Local Contexts Projects* field. For collections, dictionary words and person records, this field is located in the **Additional Fields** tab. For Digital Heritage Items, it is located in the **Permissions and Rights** tab. 

    There are two menus: 
    
    - The *Local Contexts projects* menu displays all available projects. 

    - The *Local Contexts labels and notices* menu displays all labels and notices within the available projects. (Note display issue: https://github.com/MukurtuCMS/Mukurtu-CMS/issues/856.)

3. To apply ALL of the labels within a project to the content, in the *projects* menu, select the project you wish to apply. Skip the *labels and notices* menu, as applying both will display duplicate labels.

4. To apply SOME of the labels within a project, or to apply SOME labels from multiple projects, use the *labels and notices* menu. Select the specific labels and notices you wish to apply. Skip the *projects* menu as applying both will display duplicate labels.

5. When you have finished filling out the other metadata in your content form, select save. Your content will load and the labels and notices you applied will appear in the sidebar.
