# Understanding Taxonomies

Mukurtu CMS includes several taxonomies (sometimes called vocabularies) in its metadata schema. Each taxonomy includes a list of terms used for categorizing content. For example:

- The taxonomy *category* could include the terms *arts*, *politics and sovereignty*, and *migration*.  
- The taxonomy *language* could include the terms *English*, *Espa√±ol*, and *Snchitsu'umshtsn*.

Mukurtu uses taxonomies to enable reuse of a term within a field (eg: selecting a creator's name from an existing list, instead of entering their name each time), as filterable facets in search pages, and in search indices.

Most taxonomic fields allow the addition of new terms while creating content. The exceptions are *categories* and *community types*, which need to be created in advance by a Mukurtu administrator.

Mukurtu includes the following stock taxonomies:
