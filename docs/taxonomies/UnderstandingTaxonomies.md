# Understanding Taxonomies

Mukurtu CMS includes several taxonomies (sometimes called vocabularies) in its metadata schema. Each taxonomy includes a list of terms used for categorizing content. For example, a vocabulary called "Fruit" would contain the terms "Apple" and "Banana".

Mukurtu uses taxonomies to enable re-use of a term within a field (eg: selecting a creator's name from an existing list, instead of entering their name each time), as filter-able facets in search pages, and in search indices.

Most taxonomic fields allow the addition of terms while creating content. The exceptions are *categories* and *community types*, which need to be created in advance by a Mukurtu administrator.

Mukurtu includes the following stock taxonomies:
