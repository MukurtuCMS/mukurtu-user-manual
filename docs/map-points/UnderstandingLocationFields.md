# Understanding Location Fields

Mukurtu CMS offers three different location fields to help geographically represent and describe content items. These include:

- Map points: a mapping tool
- Location description: a full HTML field that allows a text or media description of a location
- Location: a taxonomic field

All of the location fields are found in the Additional Fields tab when creating all content types. 

## Map points

Map points is a visual, interactive location tool that allows users to pinpoint and label a precise location or area on a map. You can use map points to include specific geographic latitude and longitude references, as well as path, polygon, rectangle, and circle layers to help outline or visually represent areas. 
Map points is powered by Leaflet, an OpenStreetMap project. For more information on the Leaflet and OpenStreetMap projects, visit [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) or [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about). 
For more information and instructions on using the map points field, visit [Create Map Points](CreateMapPoints.md).

## Location description 

Location description can be used to provide a text or media reference to a geographical location that is impossible or inadvisable to pinpoint on a map. This can be useful if the location should remain private, if the location no longer exists, or if the location was described in a way that makes rendering it on a modern map challenging. Location description can be used independently of other location fields, and is a full HTML field that supports text, audio, images, and video.

## Location 

Location is a taxonomic field that feeds into the location taxonomy. Multiple location terms can be applied to any one content item, which can help to more clearly identify a location that has been known by different names.
