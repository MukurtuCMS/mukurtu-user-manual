Mukurtu allows users to create and manage map points and areas using the embedded Leaflet maps. Mukurtu users can use the map functions to visually mark the physical location of content. **MAYBE COMBINE THESE SENTENCES**

## Configuring your map

If you have location settings enabled in your browser, your map will automatically center on your location. If you do not have location settings enabled in your browser, the map will automatically center in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Zoom out by selecting the "-" icon to enlarge your map, or select and drag the map to a different location.

You can easily add and label features on your map, including markers, polylines, rectangles, and polygons. 

## Add a marker

1. To add a marker, or point, to your map, select the "Draw Marker" icon in the top right-hand corner of the map.

2. Select a location on the map to place a marker. There is no limit on the number of markers you can drop.

3. Select "Cancel" to finish dropping markers.

## Add a polyline

Polylines are lines that consist of multiple joined points to create a path. This can be useful for highlighting significant routes or roads. Follow the directions to draw a polyline layer on your map.

1. To add a polyline to your map, select the "Draw polyline" icon from the right-hand edge of your map.

2. Select the beginning of your polyline on the map to place the first marker, or vertex. There is no limit on the number of vertices you can drop.

3. Continue your line by placing another vertex. A line will connect the two vertices.

4. To finish your line, select an existing marker.

Rectangles can indicate an area. Follow the directsion to add a rectangle layer to your map.

1. To add a rectangle to your map, select the "Draw Rectangle" icon from the right-hand edge of your map.

3. Move your cursor to select a location for your final vertex. This vertex will be opposite the first vertex and the rectangle will be shaped between them.

4. Select the location to place your final vertex to complete your rectangle.
