## Mukurtu Administrator

The Mukurtu administrator can add new languages to the site through the Manage Taxonomies page. For detailed instructions, see [Add a Dictionary Language](AddLanguage.md)

## Protocol Stewards

## Language Steward

The language steward can create, edit and delete any dictionary word and word list within their protocol. They can also upload media and assign protocols to media assets.

## Language Contributor

The language contributor can create, edit and delete their own dictionary words and word lists within their protocol but cannot edit or delete those created by other users. They can also upload media and assign protocols to media assets.
