# Dictionary Roles

## Dictionary Roles
In Mukurtu 4, dictionary words are created and managed by the language steward and language contributor. These are roles within protocols, and as such, are assigned by the protocol steward. This means that dictionary words are always created within a protocol and assigned to at least one protocol. 

## Language Steward

The language steward can create, edit and delete any dictionary word and word list within their protocol. They can also upload media and assign protocols to media assets.

## Language Contributor

The language contributor can create, edit and delete their own dictionary words and word lists within their protocol but cannot edit or delete those created by other users. They can also upload media and assign protocols to media assets.
