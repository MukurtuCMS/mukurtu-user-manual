# Add a Dictionary Language

All dictionary words must be associated with one language listed in the language taxonomy. Languages can be added to the language taxonomy two ways:
- When a digital heritage item is created by using the *language* field. See [Creating a Digital Heritage Item](../digital-heritage-items/CreateDHItem.md) for more information.
- Directly adding a language to the language taxonomy.

To add a language, INSERT STEPS HERE

Or navigate directly to `/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/language/overview`

If the language you want to use is already listed, no further action is needed.

If the language is not already listed, select "+ Add Term".

Enter the language name in the *Term* field, as you want it to appear on the site.
The *Description* field is optional, and display in INSERT CONTEXT HERE.
When ready:

- If you want to add more languages, select "Save" and the page will reload so you can continue to add more terms.
- If you do not need to add more languages, click "Save and go to list" to return to the language taxonomy list.

In either case, a confirmation message will be displayed, and you can now use this language when creating dictionary words.
