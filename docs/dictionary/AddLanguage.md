# Add a Dictionary Language

All dictionary words must be associated with one language, and that language must be listed in the language taxonomy list. Languages can be added to the language list two ways:

- When a digital heritage item is created, if the language field has been used, those languages will be included in the languages list. See [Creating a Digital Heritage Item](../digital-heritage-items/CreateDHItem.md) for more information.
- Manually adding a language to the list.

To add a language to the list, first navigate to the language taxonomy page. 

INSERT STEPS HERE

Or go directly to `/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/language/overview`

If the language you want to use is already listed, no further action is needed.

If the language is not already listed, select "Add Term".

In the *Name* field enter the language name as you want it to appear on the site.

The *Description* field is optional, and displayed INSERT CONTEXT HERE.

When ready:

- If you need to add more languages, select "Save" and the page will reload so you can continue to add more terms, or;
- If you do not need to add more languages, click "Save and go to list" to return to the language list.

In either case, a confirmation message will be displayed, and you can now use this language when creating dictionary words.
